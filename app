For the Slack app request, here’s a justification for each of the scopes you mentioned:

Bot Token Scopes

1. channels:read: This scope allows the bot to read information about channels in the workspace, which is essential for identifying the appropriate channels to send messages to. It's needed to determine where notifications or updates should be posted and to ensure the bot doesn't send messages to irrelevant channels.


2. chat:write: This permission allows the bot to send messages to channels. Since the bot's primary function is to communicate updates, alerts, or messages directly within Slack, this scope is crucial for message delivery to specific channels, ensuring team members receive necessary notifications.



User Token Scopes

1. chat:write: This scope enables the user account associated with the token to post messages. This is useful if the app requires sending messages on behalf of a user or needs to appear more personalized. It allows for scenarios where a message should come from a user instead of a bot, ensuring flexibility in how information is delivered.


2. im:history: This scope is essential to access the message history in direct messages (IMs) with the user. It’s useful for tracking prior interactions to maintain context or to avoid sending duplicate messages. This history can also help in providing more relevant responses based on past conversations.


3. im:write: This permission allows the app to send direct messages to users, facilitating personalized notifications or direct interactions for specific individuals rather than entire channels. It’s important for ensuring sensitive or user-specific notifications are delivered in a private, direct manner.



These scopes collectively ensure that the app can efficiently communicate with users and channels while maintaining message relevancy and context.
